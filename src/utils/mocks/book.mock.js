       summary:`Bilbo Baggins, a reluctant hobbit, sets out on an adventure to help dwarves reclaim their lost kingdom.`,
        description: "Hobbits, a race of small humanlike creatures, characteristically value peace, simplicity, and cozy homes yet are capable of incredible feats of courage and resourcefulness. The unwilling hero of The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, is persuaded by the wizard Gandalf to leave his village, Hobbiton, and join Thorin and his 12 dwarfs to recover their stolen treasure, which is being guarded by the dragon Smaug. During the expedition, Bilbo finds a magical ring that renders the wearer invisible, which figures prominently in The Lord of the Rings, a novel originally published in three parts that followed in 1954−55. When Bilbo and Gandalf return to Hobbiton, Bilbo is no longer accepted, his adventurous behavior being deemed unhobbitlike. The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo’s maturing from a seeker of warmth and comforts to a fighter, however humble, for the greater good. He proves to be an unlikely hero who achieves metamorphosis through pools of inner strength he did not know he possessed.",

        description: `The Lord of the Rings is about Sauron's attempts to gain the One Ring of Power, and thereby conquer Middle-earth. The Ring is in the hands of Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit, who is warned by his friend Gandalf. With the help of friends from home and friends he meets along the way, Frodo travels across Middle-earth to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom before Sauron finds it (and him).

The Fellowship of the Ring
Frodo inherits a ring from his uncle, Bilbo Baggins, but soon learns from the Wizard Gandalf that it is the infamous Ring of Power. Knowing the Dark Lord Sauron will be searching for it, Frodo embarks on a journey towards the Elven town of Rivendell. His friend Samwise Gamgee insists on accompanying him. Frodo and Sam are then joined by their friends, Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took. With the help of a man named Strider, they arrive in Rivendell. Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, the heir to the throne of Gondor. Gandalf informs them that the powerful Wizard Saruman has joined Sauron.

At Rivendell, the Council of Elrond decides that a group of nine, dubbed "The Fellowship of the Ring," will set off to destroy the Ring in Mordor's Mount Doom, which is deep in Sauron's territory. Frodo Baggins is to be the ring-bearer and must ultimately destroy the Ring when they arrive. While traveling through the Mines of Moria, Gandalf falls into an abyss while battling a fire demon known as the Balrog. Without their leader, the Fellowship is shaken, and even a brief respite with the Elf Galadriel cannot heal their bond. Desperate to protect his home nation of Gondor, Boromir tries to steal the Ring from Frodo, and Frodo runs away from the Fellowship. Sam follows him.`,
